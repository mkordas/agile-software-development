# Tips for Daily Scrum

* What did I accomplish yesterday? (not what I was doing)
* What will I complete today? (not what I will be doing)
* What obstacles are impeding my progress?

Keep rules
- Max 15 min overall, one minute per person
- Focus on work to be done, not on calendar
- Assign action to a person for each blocker
- Same place, same time - blindly or not?

Experiment
- Tea standup
- Do sit-down

> What did I do yesterday? I can’t remember... What am I doing today? No idea...

* What you did to change the world yesterday
* How you are going to crush it today
* How you are going to blast through any obstacles unfortunate enough to be
standing in your way

Order:
- last speaks first
- round robin
- token
- draw a card

To start a day or not?

Red flags
- no focus on story progress
- reporting to leader
- people beign late
- starts a day too late
- don't remember
  - walking the board
  - responsibility
- too long stories
  - take it offline
- problem solving
  - take it offline

> If we can’t clearly articulate a plan for what we’ll do today, then perhaps we
have unclear goals or obstacles in our path. If other people in the group don’t
find our plan compelling, then perhaps we have misaligned goals or work is
falling through the cracks.

- Is someone stuck?
- Are urgent tasks actioned?
- Does everyone know what to do?
- Is there any waste?
