in a turbulent business environment
>> Jutta Eckstein

- Non-stop requirements
- Thorough understanding
- Continuous discovery
- Refinement
- Explanation to the team
- Proper prioritization

Pareto rule
- 80% of requirements is a waste
  - better to not implement them

WHY question! Everyone needs to understand all the "whys"

> Well, the Product owner can help with some of issues, but often times the
kind of conversations and questions the development team needs to know are more
detailed than product owners can help with. As the product owner is often
overseeing several projects and splits time in different locations, it's hard
to be at the right place at the right time. Additionally, product owners focus
on understanding the market and stakeholders while agile analysts understand the
vision of the product and perform various activities in development team to
reflect that vision into the product.
