# Definition

Agile software development is a set of principles for software
development in which requirements and solutions evolve through
collaboration between **self-organizing**, **cross-functional**
teams. It promotes **adaptive planning**, **evolutionary development**,
early delivery, and **continuous improvement**, and it encourages
rapid and flexible **response to change**.

Agile itself has never defined any specific methods to achieve this,
but many have grown up as a result and have been recognized as being
agile.
