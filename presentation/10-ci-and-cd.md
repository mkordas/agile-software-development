# Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment/Delivery

### CI

Basics:
* Code repository
* Build automation
* Self-testing build
* Integration machines
* Fast build
* Clone of the production
* Automate deployment
* Frequent commits to master
* Fix broken builds immediately

Why:
* Merging Hell
* Broken Windows

To make it better...
* Pre-flight builds

### CD

Releasing good build to users.

Continuous Deployment vs. Delivery

* Risk
* Catching bugs
* Real progress
* Psychology
* User feedback

> * Your software is deployable throughout its lifecycle
> * Your team prioritizes keeping the software deployable over working on new
features
> * Anybody can get fast, automated feedback on the production readiness of
their systems any time somebody makes a change to them
> * You can perform push-button deployments of any version of the software
to any environment on demand
